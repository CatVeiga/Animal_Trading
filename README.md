## Introduction

This is my first project, for the Front-End Nanodegree at Udacity. The objective of this project is create a card with an animal and add info about that animal. The project should be created in **HTML and CSS.** 

## Installation

Go to code > copy the code > paste it on your terminal > open a server > and you should see the card on your localhost.<br>
  *This project doesn't need installation, clone the repo only if you need it.*

## Deployment

You can view the animal trading card here:

## Design Decisions
So since this was my first project I've tried to be as simple as I can. I chose colors that I've thought could match with the animal that I chose. And that was it.


## Languages

- HTML
- CSS
